`input` contains the original P4 source files.

`model-gen` is the code generated by the compiler for the express purpose of being the architecture interface.
This should only be done by the target manufacturer, and should *remain* the definition of the interface between
the program and the architecture. Suggest that the original file is used, and included in the arch dll. 
Generated from `very_simple_model.p4`, which references `core.P4`.

`model-impl` is the architecture implementation provided by the target manufacturer. Should match and depend on
the output in `model-gen`.

`program` is the generated C# for the actual P4 program (`vss-example.p4`). Not that this file references both
of the other P4 files.
